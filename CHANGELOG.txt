Added modal lightbox for review images with fixed layout, fullscreen mode, scroll-wheel navigation, swipe gestures, and pinch-to-zoom on mobile.

Improved review image browsing with centered next/previous controls, image index indicator, and stable progress bar.

Enforced a strict maximum of 5 images per review with immediate frontend validation and backend safeguards.

Improved image upload UX with clear error messages, previews, removal controls, and accurate remaining-image feedback.

Fixed multiple edge cases around review image rendering, navigation, and interaction consistency across desktop and mobile.

Known limitation

Review images are still stored on the backend’s local filesystem and may disappear after backend restarts; migration to persistent object storage (S3) is planned.

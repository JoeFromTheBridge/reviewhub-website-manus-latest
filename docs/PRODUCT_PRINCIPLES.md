# ReviewHub Product Principles

Inspired by timeless design philosophies (e.g., Apple’s "1000 No’s"), adapted for ReviewHub — a consumer review platform that values clarity, trust, and user delight.

---

## 1. Simplicity = Sophistication
- Every key task (find, read, write a review) must be achievable in ≤3 intuitive steps.
- If the interface needs explanation, redesign it.
- Clutter is debt: show less, mean more.

## 2. Question Everything
- Each feature must answer two questions before development:
  1. Why does this matter to the user?
  2. How does it make ReviewHub better?
- Review features quarterly and prune unused or confusing flows.

## 3. Start with UX, Work Back to Tech
- Design thin vertical slices: clickable UI → stubbed backend → real API.
- Define success in user terms (e.g., “Find a relevant review in <10 seconds”).

## 4. Perfection is in the Details
- Consistent spacing, typography, and image ratios.
- Predictable behavior for loading, errors, and empty states.
- No stretched or misaligned assets. Ever.

## 5. Innovation through Clarity
- Opinionated defaults (e.g., "Most Helpful" sorting, auto-collapse long reviews).
- Small, smart features > large, unproven systems.
- Always ship the smallest version that delivers delight.

## 6. One Integrated Stack
- One source of truth for product, category, and review data.
- Frontend should never reshape backend IDs or enums.
- Validate API contracts regularly.

## 7. Say No to 1,000 Things
- Every sprint, focus on 1–2 measurable outcomes.
- Remove features or copy that don’t serve the goal.
- “Less, but better” is the north star.

## 8. Prototype. Ship. Learn.
- Prototype new flows before coding.
- Ship fast in small increments.
- Measure success, refine, repeat.
